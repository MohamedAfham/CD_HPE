## Pose Definition
We follow the Leeds Sports Pose Dataset pose definition with 14 joints labeling, namely, 

`Right ankle
Right knee
Right hip
Left hip
Left knee
Left ankle
Right wrist
Right elbow
Right shoulder
Left shoulder

The lable matrix `joints_gt_<modality>.mat` has the format  `<x,y,if_occluded>` x n_joints x n_subjects
